  - [x] Play/pause/next/previous controls
  - [x] Track deletion
  - [x] Mobile vibration feedback

### Phase 3: Volume + Mute Controls ✅
- [x] Created /app/modules/volumeControl.js with:
  - [x] Volume slider control
  - [x] Mute/unmute toggle
  - [x] Visual UI state updates

### Phase 4: Playlist UI Modernization ✅
- [x] Moved playlist rendering into updateTrackList() function
- [x] Added delete button per track
- [x] Implemented active track highlighting

## Implementation Details

### Architecture Changes
- **Modular Design**: Split functionality into logically separated modules
- **State Encapsulation**: Each module manages its own state
- **Clean Interfaces**: Exposed only necessary functions from each module
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: More robust error handling and user feedback
- **Better Debugging**: Improved debug UI for development

### Challenges Addressed
1. **Peer Connection**: Improved peer connection handling with proper cleanup
2. **Audio Stream Management**: Better management of audio streams and elements
3. **Firebase Integration**: Cleaner integration with Firebase for music synchronization
4. **DOM References**: More robust DOM element handling

## Retained Features
- PeerJS voice communication
- Firebase music synchronization
- Local playlist management
- Room-based architecture
- Mobile responsive design

## Bonus Deliverables
- Improved documentation with README and implementation notes
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback
- Streamlined code with better modularity
- Mobile-optimized touch feedback

## Next Steps
- Implement playlist import/export
- Add localStorage for persistent playlists
- Add preloaded example tracks
- Show playback progress in tracklist

## Testing Notes
- Tested basic connection functionality
- Verified module initialization
- Confirmed Firebase integration works
- Validated proper event binding
