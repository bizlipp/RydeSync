- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No heavy frameworks, just plain JS, HTML, and CSS

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or newer)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aerovista/rydesync.git
   cd rydesync
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your Firebase configuration:

```
# Firebase Configuration
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_PROJECT.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_PROJECT.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_APP_ID

# Environment
NODE_ENV=development
```

3. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Access the application at `http://localhost:9000`

## üîå Plugin System

RydeSync supports plugins to customize rooms with themes, playlists, and special features.

### Creating a Plugin

1. Create a new JS file in the `plugins/` directory (e.g., `plugins/myplugin.js`)
2. Export a plugin configuration object:

```javascript
// plugins/myplugin.js
export default {
  theme: 'myplugin',
  title: 'My Custom Room',
  styles: '/themes/myplugin.css',
  musicLoop: true,
  allowMic: true,
  playlist: [
    { title: 'Track 1', url: 'https://example.com/music/track1.mp3' },
    { title: 'Track 2', url: 'https://example.com/music/track2.mp3' },
  ],
  components: ['custom-feature-1', 'custom-feature-2']
};
```

3. Add your plugin to the main index file:

```javascript
// plugins/index.js
import myplugin from './myplugin.js';

export const roomPlugins = {
  // Add your plugin with its room key
  myplugin,
  // Other plugins...
};
```

4. Create a CSS file for your theme in `public/themes/` if needed

### Using a Plugin

Plugins are automatically activated when a user joins a room with the same name as the plugin key. For example, joining a room named "myplugin" will activate the "myplugin" plugin.

## üîä Room System

### Joining a Room

1. Enter a room name in the input field
2. Click "Join Room"
3. If the room exists, you'll connect to existing participants
4. If the room doesn't exist, a new room will be created

### Music Synchronization

When a music track is played in a room:

1. The track information is shared with all participants
2. All clients play the track at the same position
3. Drift correction ensures synchronization is maintained
4. Play/pause state is synchronized across all clients

### Network Resilience

- Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff when connection is lost
- Status indicators show connection state
- Peer activity visualization shows active participants

## üîê Security & Privacy

- No voice data is stored
- No user accounts required
- Peer-to-peer connections for direct communication
- HTTPS recommended for production deployments

## üì± Mobile Usage

- Responsive design works on mobile devices
- Touch gestures for music player control
- Audio continues in background on supported browsers
- Haptic feedback on interactions when available

## üß∞ Advanced Usage

### Custom STUN/TURN Servers

For improved NAT traversal, you can configure custom STUN/TURN servers in `public/app.js`:

```javascript
const peer = new Peer(undefined, {
  // ... other options
  config: {
    iceServers: [
      { urls: 'stun:your-stun-server.com:3478' },
      {
        urls: 'turn:your-turn-server.com:3478',
        username: 'username',
        credential: 'password'
      }
    ]
  }
});
```

### Room Capacity

The peer-to-peer architecture works best with small to medium groups:

- **Recommended**: 2-5 users for optimal performance
- **Maximum**: 8-10 users, depending on connection quality
- For larger groups, consider using a selective forwarding unit (SFU)

## Important Notes

- Scripts must be loaded as ES modules (with `type="module"` attribute)
- Environment variables must be set for Firebase configuration
- Firebase security rules should be properly configured for production use

## Troubleshooting

### Module Loading Issues

If you see `Uncaught SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module`, make sure all scripts are loaded with `type="module"` in your HTML:

```html
<script type="module" src="app.js"></script>
<script type="module" src="musicPlayer.js"></script>
<script type="module" src="musicSync.js"></script>
```

### Firebase Configuration

If Firebase fails to initialize, check your `.env` file and ensure all required environment variables are set correctly.
